                <p>I'm making a career transition from
                    the medical field into software development.
                    I am teaching myself, and I'm currently
                    learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <p>I was a surgical tech for almost 3 years.
                    It definitely wasn't something I could see
                    myself doing forever. I was burnt out, and it
                    hadn't even been 3 years.

                <p>I know that coding is hard, but I 
                    know that the feeling of accomplishment
                    when I've finally landed that first job
                    will be worth it, and I'm so excited to 
                    see what the future holds.
